# EroCool Downloader Lite

## At First

Well, this is the first repository I create on Github. I have been learning programing on my own for some time, and it fascinates me so much. What I've done so far is quite simple and tiny, but it means a lot to me. I will keep learning and I wish in the future, I could write more useful programs.

## How to Use

You can find the executable file in [releases](https://github.com/PetrelPine/EroCoolDownloaderLite/releases), or you can clone this repository and make your own changes.

## Future Improvements

+ Support multi-thread to download images.

+ Finish EroCool Downloader's full version.

## At Last

I'm looking forward to your suggestions for improvements. Enjoy!

*If you like this repository, could you give it a star for support :)*
